I’m deep into mobile development, happily experimenting with AI-assisted coding, and lately I’ve been tinkering with backend projects as well. I have solid, hands-on experience in Wi-Fi and related domains, and I genuinely enjoy understanding how things work under the hood.

I’m currently exploring opportunities in mobile and backend development where I can learn fast, ship often, and build meaningful products end to end.

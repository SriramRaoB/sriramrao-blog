description: why I’m finally starting to write about technology, coding, and AI.

Welcome to **Sriram.dev** — my personal corner of the internet.

For years, I wanted to write a blog, but work always took priority. As the new year begins, I’m finally starting.

This blog will be a space to capture my thoughts on **technology**, **coding**, and **AI** — the areas I’m most curious and excited about.

## About Me

My name is Sriram, and I’ve been programming for over 20 years. I began during my engineering days, and it has been a long and rewarding journey since then. Most of my professional career has been focused on **iOS** and **macOS** development, dating back to the *macOS Tiger* era.

Right now feels like one of the most exciting times to be in software, largely due to **AI** and the rapid pace of evolution.

## Writing Commitment

I plan to publish a new post here every week. By sharing this commitment publicly, I aim to hold myself accountable and build a consistent writing habit.


## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Software engineering
- Technology
- Things I'm learning

Stay tuned for more posts.
